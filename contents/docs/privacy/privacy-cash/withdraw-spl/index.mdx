## Withdraw SPL Tokens

Withdraw USDC or USDT privately from the Privacy Cash pool using zero-knowledge proofs.

### Example

```typescript
import { PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { PrivacyCash } from 'privacycash';

const client = new PrivacyCash({
    RPC_url: 'YOUR_SOLANA_MAINNET_RPC_URL',
    owner: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
});

// USDC mint address
const mintAddress = new PublicKey('EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v');

async function withdrawUsdc() {
    const recipientAddress = 'RECIPIENT_ADDRESS';

    // Check balance first
    const privateBalance = await client.getPrivateBalanceSpl(mintAddress);
    console.log('USDC balance:', privateBalance.amount);

    // Withdraw 2 USDC
    const withdrawRes = await client.withdrawSPL({
        mintAddress,
        amount: 2,
        recipientAddress
    });
    console.log(withdrawRes);

    // Check balance after withdrawal
    const balanceAfter = await client.getPrivateBalanceSpl(mintAddress);
    console.log('USDC balance after withdraw:', balanceAfter.amount);
}

withdrawUsdc();
```
