## Get Private Balance

Query your private SOL balance in the Privacy Cash pool.

### Example

```typescript
import { PrivacyCash } from 'privacycash';

const client = new PrivacyCash({
    RPC_url: 'YOUR_SOLANA_MAINNET_RPC_URL',
    owner: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
});

async function checkBalance() {
    const privateBalance = await client.getPrivateBalance();
    console.log('Private balance:', privateBalance.lamports / 1_000_000_000, 'SOL');
}

checkBalance();
```

### Notes

- Balance is derived from your wallet's private key
- Only you can query your balance
- Historical UTXOs are cached locally for faster performance
- Use `client.clearCache()` if you encounter issues and need a full refresh
