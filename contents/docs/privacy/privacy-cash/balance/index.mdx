## Get Private Balance

Query your private SOL balance in the Privacy Cash pool.

### Example with @solana/kit

```typescript
import { PrivacyCash } from 'privacycash';
import { createSolanaRpc } from '@solana/kit';

const rpc = createSolanaRpc('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');

const checkBalance = async () => {
    // Check private balance using your note
    const balance = await PrivacyCash.getPrivateBalance({
        rpc,
        note: 'your-deposit-note-here',
    });

    console.log('Private balance:', balance, 'lamports');
};

checkBalance();
```

### Notes

- Balance is derived from your deposit note
- Only you can query your balance with your note
- Keep your note secure - anyone with it can withdraw your funds
