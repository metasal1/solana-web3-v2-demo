## Withdraw SOL

Withdraw SOL from the Privacy Cash privacy pool to any address. The withdrawal uses zero-knowledge proofs to break the link between deposit and withdrawal addresses.

### Example with @solana/kit

```typescript
import { withdraw } from 'privacycash';
import { createSolanaRpc, createSolanaRpcSubscriptions, address } from '@solana/kit';

const rpc = createSolanaRpc('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
const rpcSubscriptions = createSolanaRpcSubscriptions('wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');

const withdrawSol = async () => {
    const recipient = address('recipient-address-here');

    // Withdraw to any address
    const result = await withdraw({
        rpc,
        rpcSubscriptions,
        note: 'your-deposit-note-here', // The note from your deposit
        recipient,
    });

    console.log('Withdrawal successful:', result);
};

withdrawSol();
```

### How it Works

1. Provide your deposit note (proof of deposit)
2. A zero-knowledge proof is generated
3. The proof verifies you have a valid deposit without revealing which one
4. SOL is sent to your specified recipient address
5. No on-chain link exists between deposit and withdrawal

### Fees

- 0.35% + 0.006 SOL per withdrawal

### Privacy Tips

- Wait some time between deposit and withdrawal
- Withdraw to a fresh address for maximum privacy
- Consider splitting large amounts into multiple deposits/withdrawals
