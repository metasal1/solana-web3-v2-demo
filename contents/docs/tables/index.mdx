description: Address Lookup Tables / Lookup Tables (ALT / LUT)
---

Basically, because Solana Transactions have a maximum size that is limited, ALT allow you to do more things by creating a table to reference instead of a inserting addresses.

Think of it like an index / rolodex that points to another location that contains the full address you need.

Another advantage is that you can create the ALT once and use it all the time.

Things you can do;

- Create 
- Fetch
- Add (extend) it
- Delete / truncate it
